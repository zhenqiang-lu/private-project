Step 2:Image setting detail description.<br/>
• Hue: Changes the color mix of the image (this can have very dramatic results). <br/>
• Brightness: Changes how bright the image appears to be. The bigger number the brighter effect.<br/>
• Contrast: The separation between the darkest and brightest areas of the image. <br/>
• Saturation: Alters how much color is displayed in the image. The higher the saturation, the more bright and vivid colors will appear to be.<br/>
• Sharpness: Sharpen image to increase the Signal Noise Ratio .<br/>
• Mirror: Change the orientation of the image to be horizontally reversed. <br/>
• Turn: Change the orientation of the image to be vertically reversed. <br/>
• Camera Angle:Angle Change the orientation of the image to 90°、180°、270° or normal. <br/>
3DNR: 3D-Noise Ratio: if Enabled may decrease the noise of the image.<br/>
• LUX: Adjust Illuminance value, the bigger the number the easier to trigger the infrared. Set to “0” to turn off the IR lights and set to “9” to keep the IR lights always on. <br/>
• Dewarping: refers to the process of perspective correction of an image, to reverse the effects of geometric distortions caused by the camera lens. Most commonly known as a “Fisheye” and/or “360º” device. <br/>
• Led intensity:Led intensity Adjust the intensity of LED lights. Set to “0” to turn off the LED lights. The bigger the number the stronger the intensity. <br/>
• Exposure Mode: <br/>
Auto: Select the exposure level of the camera based on pre-defined conditions. <br/>
Manual: Manual: Adjust shutter speed and gain value of the camera manually. <br/>
• Shutter: Known as “exposure time”, stands for the length of time a camera shutter is open to expose light into the camera sensor. <br/>If the shutter speed is fast, it can help to freeze action completely. <br/>If the shutter speed is slow, it can create an effect called “motion blur”, where moving objects appear blurred along the direction of the motion. This effect is used quite a bit in advertisements of cars and motorbikes, where a sense of speed and motion is communicated to the viewer by intentionally blurring the moving wheels. <br/>
• BLC Mode:<br/>
WDR: Turning on the Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) feature for photos improves the overall exposure throughout your entire image. It enables the camera to pick up greater detail in dark shadows, while making sure that the highlights don't get blown-out.<br/>
DWDR: Digital wide dynamic range (D-WDR) is a software-based technique that optimizes image quality by adjusting the gamma (γ) value to enhance dark areas.<br/>
BLC: Back-light Compensation (BLC) optimizes exposure in the foreground and background of security video. It splits the video scene into different regions and uses a different exposure for each of these regions. It corrects regions with extremely high or low levels of light to maintain a normal and usable level of light for the object in focus.<br/>
HLC: 	Highlight Compensation (HLC) senses strong sources of light in video and compensates for exposure on these spots to enhance the overall quality.<br/>
• Backlight compensation: turn off, WDR, DWDR, backlight compensation, glare, preset value to turn off.<br/>
• FLC:<br/>
50Hz: in the case of 50Hz, the exposure is automatically adjusted according to the brightness of the scene to ensure that the image does not appear horizontal stripes. <br/>
The 60Hz: in the case of 60Hz, according to the brightness of the scene, automatically adjust the exposure to ensure that the image does not appear horizontal stripes. <br/> 
The outdoor: this mode can be switched to light exposure, the effect of the corresponding exposure mode.<br/> 
• Anti flicker: outdoor, 50Hz, 60Hz optional. Preset value for outdoor.<br/>
• Day/Night:<br/>
Color: Display only color images.<br/>
Black and white: Only black and white images are displayed. <br/>
Automatic: According to the CDS illuminance to switch to display color or black and white images.<br/>
Time: Toggle the color or black and white image according to the set time.<br/>

<p>
Step 1:Select“Settings > Network > TCP/IP”.<br/>
Step 2:TCP/IP Parameters.<br/>
• Allows up to 10 devices log in at the same time. <br/>
• DHCP <br/>
Enable DHCP: DHCP is a system where one device on your network (usually a router) will automatically assign IP address to device connected to the network.<br/>
Disable DHCP(Static): Static networks require all devices to have their IP addresses manually defined, as there is no device dedicated to automatically assign IP address. <br/>
• IPv4/IPv6 Address, just as families and offices need an address to determine where they are on the network. <br/>
The IPv4 address: Four groups of 0 and 255 between the digital components, and separated from the full stop. For example, a typical IP address may be "192.168.1.24" or similar.
The IPv6 address: IPv6 address length is 128 bits, is 4 times the length of the IPv4 address, said the sixteen digit, and by a colon. For example, a typical IP address is "2001:250:3000:1: 1:7" or similar.
IPv4 Subnet - If the IP address is like a street address, then a sub-network is like your neighborhood.<br/>
The This will be formatted in a similar way to the IP address (ie. four numbers up to 255 separated by periods but contain very different numbers.)
The In the above example, the Subnet might be something like: "255.255.255.0".
Gateway This is the address of - the way to the Internet. "To continue the road analogy, this is like your local access point to the highway. This is an IP in the same, format the others  as and  is typically very similar  to the IP address, address  of, Camera.
The To continue the above example, it might be something such as: "192.168.1.1".<br/>
• DNS sets the DNS server address. I suggest you make an automatic DNS here and let people set it. If it's wrong, you won't be able to use MAC.<br/>
MAC Address network card physical address. This is a unique code. You can't change it - it's preset when you leave the factory. <br/>
• The service port provided by Http Port HTTP communications defaults to 80 and can be logged in using the http://ip:port pipeline login device. <br/>
• Ie. http://ip:port (http://56.236.333.237:80).<br/>
• Service port provided by Onvif Port ONVIF communication, defaults to 85.<br/>
• The service port provided by RTSPPort RTSP communications defaults to 554.<br/>

<h2>Appendix 1 Glossary of Terms<h2>
<h3>1 WDR</h3>
<p>
WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) is the technique aim to reproduce a similar range of luminance through adapting to the different exposure level presented in the environment, by collecting two different level of exposure of the same picture twice and combining them. The WDR feature will allow the dark area to be brighter and darken over-expose area, allowing detail other-wise dampened by over-exposure (glare) and under-exposure.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>2 DWDR</h3>
<p> With the same aim as WDR, DWDR (Digital Wide Dynamic Range) adjust the exposure by digitally adjusting the contrast and gamma value of the picture, reducing the effect of glare. Unlike WDR is done by the hardware, DWDR may cause the picture to appear washed-out.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>3 BLC</h3>
<p> 
BLC (Backlight Compensation) increase the overall exposure of the entire picture to reduce the contrast between the background and the main interest area. The overall viewable area will improve but area with brightly-lit area will be overexposed. 
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>4 HLC</h3>
<p>
HLC (Highlight Compensation) reduce the overall exposure in the main interest area to reduce the effect of strong light. It is the reverse of BLC because HLC target the lighting generated in the main interest area.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>5 3DNR</h3>
<p> 
 3DNR (3D Noise Reduction) is the technique used to reduce video noise by analyzing and compare the difference between each successive frames in order to adjust video pixel. With 3DNR, there will be a trade-off between video crisp and motion blur.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>6 IPv6</h3>
<p>
  IPv6 is the next version of IP (Internet Protocol), the communication protocol that provides an identification and location system for traffic-routing across the networks. It is designed by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to replace IPv4 in the anticipation of IPv4 address exhaustion. 
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>7 FTP</h3>
<p> 
 FTP (File transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer files between two end-points (computers) on a network. FTP is an application that exists in different operation system which follows the same set of standard for file transportation, allowing file transfer across different plateforms.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>8 DHCP</h3>
<p>  DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol that allows a server (in most cases, a router/modem) to automatically assign an IP address to a connected device from a defined range of IP numbers. DHCP allows a uniformly assigned network environment across different devices.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>9 DDNS</h3>
<p>
DDNS (Dynamic Domain Name System) is a system to automatically update the client’s dynamic IP address to a static domain name, thus allow a consistent connection without the need to check dynamic IP address. The update client will send the IP address in real time, based on a predefined interval, to a server hosting the static domain name, which in term allows other domain name server to acknowledge the new IP address, without the need to manually changing the record.
</p>
<br/><br/>


<h3>10 HTTPS</h3>
<p> 
HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol which data is sent between browser and the website connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted using SSL. 
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>11 PPPOE</h3>
<p> 
PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is a network protocol for encapsulating Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames inside Ethernet frames. It is used mainly with DSL services where individual users connect to a DSL modem over Ethernet.
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>12 RTSP</h3>
<p>
RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is a network protocol designed to allow system to control streaming media servers and is used to establish and control media session between two end-points over TCP/IP. 
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>13 ONVIF</h3>
<p> 
ONVIF is the global and open industry standard for interfacing between video surveillance product and other physical security areas. The standard defines device discoveries, live video and audio standard, bit rate, and controls, ensuring compatibility between different manufacturer. 
</p>
<br/><br/>

<h3>14 H265</h3>
<p>  H.265 is the successor to the H.264 video encoding standard. The aim for H.265 is to improve bit rate, video quality, and overall video performance. Compare to H.264, H.265 only needs half of the require data to achieve the same video quality as H.264.
